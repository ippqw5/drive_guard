DriveGuard API documentation
=======================================================

Welcome to the DriveGuard API documentation!

DriveGuard provides a set of easy-to-use Python API for controlling and monitoring our real car.

In the class **drive_guard**, you can find many get/set methods which hide the complexity of ROS2 and the underlying hardware.

=======================================================

Here is a sample code snippet to get you started:

.. code-block:: python

   # Import the driveguard_interface module
   from driveguard_interface import *

   drive_guard = DriveGuard()

   # Get IMU data
   imu_data = drive_guard.get_imu_data()
   if imu_data:
      # print(f"Type: {type(imu_data)}")
      print("IMU Data:", imu_data)
   else:
      print("No IMU data received yet")

   try:
      # Get speed and twist in target frame
      while True:
         time.sleep(0.5) 
         
         pose = drive_guard.get_pose()
         vel = drive_guard.get_vel()
         
         if pose:
               print(f"Pose: {pose.vector.x}, {pose.vector.y}, {pose.vector.z}")
         else:
               print("No pose data available")
         if vel:
               print(f"Linear: {vel.linear.x}, {vel.linear.y}, {vel.linear.z} | "
                     f"Angular: {vel.angular.x}, {vel.angular.y}, {vel.angular.z}")
         else:
               print("No velocity data available")

   except KeyboardInterrupt:
      print("\nKeyboard interrupt received")
   finally:
      drive_guard.stop_robot()
      drive_guard.shutdown()
